This is a demo repo that shows two ways of putting Git's commit hash into a Python module's `__version__` attribute:

- Using [Versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer) on the `versioneer` branch
- Using [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) on the `setuptools-scm` branch.

I talk about this in my Normconf 2022 lightning talk.
